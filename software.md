# Gurobify

Gurobify provides an interface to the [Gurobi Optimizer](http://www.gurobi.com) software from [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org). It enables the creation and modification of mixed integer and linear programming models which can be solved directly by Gurobi from within the GAP environment.
