In 2020 I was admitted as a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy ([FHEA](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship)) through the UWA Academy Fellowship Scheme. In 2021 I earned a [Graduate Certificate in Tertiary Teaching](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/courses/graduate-certificate-in-tertiary-teaching) from UWA.

I have a [Graduate Certificate in Tertiary Teaching](https://www.uwa.edu.au/study/courses/graduate-certificate-in-tertiary-teaching) from UWA and am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy ([FHEA](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship)).

## Lecturing

<!--- **Current** --->

In Trimester 1, 2020, I lectured two undergraduate units at [Sheridan College](https://www.sheridan.edu.au/):
- **Univariate Statistical Analysis** as part of the Bachelor of Business,
-  **Linear Algebra and Calculus** as part of the Diploma of Science.

I was responsible for developing both units, since they were new.

<!--- **Previous** --->

In Semester 2, 2018, I lectured two weeks of [**Geometry (MATH3033)**](http://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=MATH3033 "MATH3033 Handbook") for John Bamberg at the University of Western Australia. As this was a new unit in 2018, I was also responsible for writing and preparing the content of the 6 lectures that I delivered. 

You can view a supplementary video that I prepared for the unit on primal/dual conics and their Caley-Klein geometries below. In it I show how the Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries introduced in class are simply special cases of something more general.
