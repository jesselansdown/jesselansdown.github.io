## Lecturing

**Current**

This trimester I am lecturing two undergraduate units at [Sheridan College](https://www.sheridan.edu.au/):
- **Univariate Statistical Analysis** as part of the Bachelor of Business,
-  **Linear Algebra and Calculus** as part of the Diploma of Science.

I am responsible for developing both units, since they are new.

**Previous**

In Semester 2, 2018, I lectured two weeks of [**Geometry (MATH3033)**](http://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=MATH3033 "MATH3033 Handbook") for John Bamberg at the University of Western Australia. As this was a new unit in 2018, I was also responsible for writing and preparing the content of the 6 lectures that I delivered. 

You can view a supplementary video that I prepared for the unit on primal/dual conics and their Caley-Klein geometries below. In it I show how the Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries introduced in class are simply special cases of something more general.
