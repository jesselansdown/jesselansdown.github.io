I am a [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/) Postdoctoral Fellow at [Tohoku University](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), where I am in the [Research Center for Pure and Applied Mathematics](https://www.math.is.tohoku.ac.jp/english/research/). 

I earned my doctorate jointly from [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/) and the [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/). I was then a postdoc in the [Centre for the Mathematics of Symmetry and Computation](http://www.cmsc.uwa.edu.au/) at the University of Western Australia, and then a lecturer and postdoc in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/schools/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).
