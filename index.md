I am a lecturer in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/engineering/schools/mathematics-statistics/) at the [University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/).
Before this, I was a postdoc in the [Centre for the Mathematics of Symmetry and Computation](http://www.cmsc.uwa.edu.au/) at the University of Western Australia.

I earned my doctorate jointly from [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/) and the [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/), under the supervision of [John Bamberg](https://johnbamberg.github.io/), [Alice Niemeyer](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Alice.Niemeyer/), and [Gordon Royle](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/gordon-royle).
