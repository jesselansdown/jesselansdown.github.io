I am a mathematician at the University of Western Australia, where I am part of the [Centre for the Mathematics of Symmetry and Computation](http://www.cmsc.uwa.edu.au/).

I have recently submitted my PhD thesis in Pure Mathematics at [The University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au/) and the [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/) as part of a  cotutelle (or joint) agreement. My supervisers are  [John Bamberg](https://johnbamberg.github.io/), [Gordon Royle](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/Gordon.Royle) and [Alice Niemeyer](http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Alice.Niemeyer/).
